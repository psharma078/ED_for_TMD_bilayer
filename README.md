Efficient Python code for simulating the band structure and topology of the continuum model of twisted Mote2 bilayer. This also includes ED code for momentum-resolved manybody eigen spectra, charge structure factor, manybody Chern number, and manybody entanglement spectra to characterize various topological phases of bilayer systems.
